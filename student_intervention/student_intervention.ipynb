In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

Classification is used when we group classes based on the categorical nature of the input. We are basically classifying the data into groups. Here we are classifying the students into two groups of \"ones who need intervention\" and \"ones who don't\". So it is a classification problem."

    "So far, we have converted all _categorical_ features into numeric values. For the next step, we split the data (both features and corresponding labels) into training and test sets. In the following code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Randomly shuffle and split the data (`X_all`, `y_all`) into training and testing subsets.\n",
    "  - Use 300 training points (approximately 75%) and 95 testing points (approximately 25%).\n",
    "  - Set a `random_state` for the function(s) you use, if provided.\n",
    "  - Store the results in `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, and `y_test`."

    "**Example of Decision Tree:** Decision tree classifier can be used in banks to classify safe and risky loans. Depending on several features (crdit score, income,terms of loan, how many other loans they have) of a person a decision tree classifier can predict whether approving a loan application is safe or risky.\n",

The features could be Age, Sex, Residency in the state where the college is, SAT/GRE/GMAT scores, Economic background, How many people in the family went to school.

    "**Answer: ** Lets first look at the table 1 i.e the table for Decision Tree classifier. Notice that the predictions have been done pretty fast. Also note that the train and test scores are high are close to each other. Even though with the increase of training points the test score decreases but remains pretty high. This gives a measure of high accuracy of the decision tree classifier. Table 2 shows the information of Logistic Regression. This classifier performs very well on training size of 100 and 300 and it makes the predictions fast enough even faster than a decision tree classifier. It should also be noted that as the training examples increase the logistic regression classifier becomes more accurate. It also doesn't overfit. Last Table shows the performance of SVM. SVM performs almost as well as the Decision Tree Classifier at the cost of time complexity. SVM classifier takes more time to classify as well as to predict and the Decision Tree Classifier or logistic regression even though its accuracy is consistently high. Considering the comaprison between the performances of the chosen classifiers we choose the Logistic Regression Classifier because of its low time complexity, simplicity, size of dataset and accuracy which becomes comparable with SVM as training size increases."

    "**Answer:** Suppose a bank wants to know based on certain given features (crdit score, income, past payment behavior etc) whether a person applyting for a loan is likely to default or not. Say we denote y=\"default\". If a person defaults we say y=1 and if not then y=0. Now based on a person's features we come up with a \"score\" and using the score we predict the probability of y=1 or y=0. Probabilities must always be from 0 to 1. probability of 0 means that we can be absolutely sure that default will happen and probability of 1 means that we can be sure that default won't happen. So suppose we get a probability of 0.9 which is very close to 1 then we can convince ourselves that default won't probably happen or there is a 90% thats default won't happen. By convention we say that if the chance is >50% or probability is >0.5 of y becoming =1 given the features mentioned above of a particular person applying for a loan then maybe the loan should be given to him since its likely that he/she won't default. This is the process through which the method adopted by me called **\"Logistic regression\"** works. It does binary classification using probability using the process mentioned above."
